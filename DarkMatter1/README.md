### Objective
Collating output of multiple teams to identify novel viral contigs in metagenomic datasets

### Overview
```
/intact/
 |
 +-- input  \\ From genes
 |
 +-- output \\ To DarkMatter2
```

### Internal JSON data
```
{
  domains: [
            {start: int, end: int,name: char},
            {start: int, end: int,name: char}
            ],
  orfs: [
          {start: int, end: int,name: char},
          {start: int, end: int,name: char}
        ]
}
```
### Required Tools and Databases
HMMer
VIGA

RVDB
Viral RefSeq 
pVOGs

### Expected Input
Assembled fasta files and associated metadata

### Projected Output
JSON file of ORFs with names, annotation, and possibly a scoring methodology? 

### Methods 
We are currrently exploring two options and comparing the overlap: 

1. Our predicted ORFs from unknown contigs are subjected to an iterative HMM search against proteins regarded as viral upstream (Team 3, known knowns and known unknowns). We will create a scoring metric that combines features such as contig length, domain abundances, and others?


2. 


We will use jackhmmer to assign putatitive names to contigs that Team 5 passed to us. We will parse jackhmmer output and generate a JSON in the outlined format to team scaling.
