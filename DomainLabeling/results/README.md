# Some basic plots for the results obtained for the domainlabeling
- Absolute counts for how many contigs were omitted.
    -- Total: 347 188 contigs
    -- Omitted: 180 820
    -- Kept: 166368

- Subcategories:
    -- Pass 1 = Dark Matter (No CDD hits)
    -- Pass 2 = More than 0 Viral Domains
    -- Pass 3 = Rest
    -- Fail 1 = > 3 Eukaryotic CDDs and > 3 Bacterial CDDs and 0 Viral CDDs
    -- Fail 2 = > 3 Eukaryotic CDDs
    -- Fail 3 = > 3 Bacterial CDDs and 0 Viral CDDs

- Boxplots showing the relative number (Number of CDD hits per taxon / Total number of CDD hits per contig)

- Scatterplot showing the log transformed contig length vs log transformed number of CDD's found in the contig
