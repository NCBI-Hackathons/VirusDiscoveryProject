# Some basic plots for the results obtained for the domainlabeling
- Absolute counts for how many contigs were omitted.
-- Total: 347 188 contigs
-- Omitted: 180 820
-- Kept: 166368
- Subcategories:
-- Pass 1 = Dark Matter (No CDD hits)
-- Pass 2 = More than 0 Viral Domains
-- Pass 3 = Rest
-- Fail 1 = > 3 Eukaryotic CDDs and > 3 Bacterial CDDs and 0 Viral CDDs
-- Fail 2 = > 3 Eukaryotic CDDs
-- Fail 3 = > 3 Bacterial CDDs and 0 Viral CDDs
- Boxplots showing the relative number (Number of CDD hits per taxon / Total number of CDD hits per contig)
- Scatterplot showing the log transformed contig length vs log transformed number of CDD's found in the contig
