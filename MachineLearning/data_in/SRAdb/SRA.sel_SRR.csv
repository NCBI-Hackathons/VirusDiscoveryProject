The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",NA

However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little to no antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with environment and lifestyle, and how complexity from the exogenous environment is matched by endogenous homeostasis. The Hadza gut metagenome structure allows to appreciate the co-adaptive functional role of the GM in complementing the human physiology, providing a better understanding of the versatility of human life and subsistence.",NA

In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",NA

To query virus-host interactions of the skin, we performed parallel metagenomic sequencing and an integrated analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) and total microbial communities. To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Our findings provide new insight into the skin virome, its interactions with the whole metagenome, and establish a foundation for understanding these dynamics in skin health and disease.",NA

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes.

We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment.

Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota.

We evaluated the colorectal cancer virome (virus community) in stool using a cohort of 90 human subjects with either healthy, adenomatous (precancerous), or cancerous colons. We utilized 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing methods to compare the colorectal cancer virome to the bacterial community. We identified no detectable difference in diversity (alpha or beta) between healthy, adenomatous, or cancerous colonic samples, but more sophisticated random forest models identified striking changes in the virus community. The majority of the cancer-associated virome consisted of temperate bacteriophages, suggesting that the community was indirectly linked to colorectal cancer by modulating bacterial community structure and function. Our data suggested that the influential phages did not exclusively infect influential bacteria, but rather acted through the community as a whole.

Both 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and shotgun metagenomic DNA sequences were acquired. Numerous species have been previously observed to be associated with birds and microbiomes. These species include opportunistic pathogens and their near-neighbors, probiotics, and environmental microbes. Detailed classification of shotgun DNA sequence data with the Sequedex analysis package provided both phylogenetic and functional profiles of all samples. Phylogenetic classification using reads from phylogenetic marker genes was consistent with (but more specific than) analysis based on 16S data. Classification of samples based on the profile of SEED subsystems indicated three distinct types of samples: fecal, mature cloacal, and immature cloacal. Statistical analysis of the determinants of sample classification indicated niche determinants in metabolism, short-chain fatty acid production, virulence, and stress response pathways. This analysis was further supported by the recovery of protein sequence of niche-specific proteins. Our work provides strong support of the hypothesis that metagenomic sequencing of condor microbiomes can inform us on diet, infections, toxicity, and several types of stress.",NA

Our data suggested that the influential phages did not exclusively infect influential bacteria, but rather acted through the community as a whole. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and likely impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.",NA

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species.

Furthermore, this approach enables only reactive responses focused on human health rather than proactive measures that protect water at its source: the watershed.Our goal is to change the way we monitor water quality in our watersheds. Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.",NA

Its risk has been linked to changes in colonic bacterial community composition. Viruses are another important component of the colonic microbial community, however they have yet to be studied in colorectal cancer despite their oncogenic potential. We evaluated the colorectal cancer virome (virus community) in stool using a cohort of 90 human subjects with either healthy, adenomatous (precancerous), or cancerous colons. We utilized 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing methods to compare the colorectal cancer virome to the bacterial community. We identified no detectable difference in diversity (alpha or beta) between healthy, adenomatous, or cancerous colonic samples, but more sophisticated random forest models identified striking changes in the virus community. The majority of the cancer-associated virome consisted of temperate bacteriophages, suggesting that the community was indirectly linked to colorectal cancer by modulating bacterial community structure and function. Our data suggested that the influential phages did not exclusively infect influential bacteria, but rather acted through the community as a whole. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and likely impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.",NA

Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little to no antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with environment and lifestyle, and how complexity from the exogenous environment is matched by endogenous homeostasis. The Hadza gut metagenome structure allows to appreciate the co-adaptive functional role of the GM in complementing the human physiology, providing a better understanding of the versatility of human life and subsistence.",NA

While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota.

To query virus-host interactions of the skin, we performed parallel metagenomic sequencing and an integrated analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) and total microbial communities. To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Our findings provide new insight into the skin virome, its interactions with the whole metagenome, and establish a foundation for understanding these dynamics in skin health and disease.",NA

Furthermore, this approach enables only reactive responses focused on human health rather than proactive measures that protect water at its source: the watershed.Our goal is to change the way we monitor water quality in our watersheds. Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.",NA

The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",NA

"445","SRR1647202","SRA200640","Viruses can impact microbiome structure and function through predation and genetic exchange, but little is known of cutaneous viral communities and their interactions with their hosts. To query virus-host interactions of the skin, we performed parallel metagenomic sequencing and an integrated analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) and total microbial communities. To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Our findings provide new insight into the skin virome, its interactions with the whole metagenome, and establish a foundation for understanding these dynamics in skin health and disease.",NA

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota.

"521","SRR5429532","SRA552400","Major gaps remain in our understanding of the ecology, evolution, biodiversity, biogeography, extinction risk, and adaptive potential of reef building corals. One of the central challenges remains that there are few informative genetic markers for studying boundaries between species, and variation within species. Reduced representation sequencing approaches, such as RADseq (Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing) have great potential for resolving such relationships. However, it is necessary to identify loci in order to make inferences for endosymbiotic organisms such as corals. Here, we examined twenty-one coral holobiont ezRAD libraries from Hawai?i, focusing on P. lobata and P. compressa, two species with contrasting morphology and habitat preference that previous studies have not resolved.We used a combination of de novo assembly and reference mapping approaches to identify and compare loci: we used reference mapping to extract and compare nearly complete mitochondrial genomes, ribosomal arrays, and histone genes. We used de novo clustering and phylogenomic methods to compare the complete holobiont data set with coral and symbiont subsets that map to transcriptomic data. In addition, we used reference assemblies to examine genetic structure from SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). All approaches resolved outgroup taxa but failed to resolve P. lobata and P. compressa as distinct, with mito-nuclear discordance and shared mitochondrial haplotypes within the species complex. The holobiont and â€˜coral transcriptomicâ€™ datasets were highly concordant, revealing stronger genetic structure between sites than between coral morphospecies. These results suggest that either branching morphology is a polymorphic trait, or that these species frequently hybridize. This study provides examples of several approaches to acquire, identify, and compare loci across metagenomic samples such as the coral holobiont while providing insights into the nature of coral variability.",NA

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infantsâ€™ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota.

"557","SRR5665115","SRA573379","Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Its risk has been linked to changes in colonic bacterial community composition. Viruses are another important component of the colonic microbial community, however they have yet to be studied in colorectal cancer despite their oncogenic potential. We evaluated the colorectal cancer virome (virus community) in stool using a cohort of 90 human subjects with either healthy, adenomatous (precancerous), or cancerous colons. We utilized 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing methods to compare the colorectal cancer virome to the bacterial community. We identified no detectable difference in diversity (alpha or beta) between healthy, adenomatous, or cancerous colonic samples, but more sophisticated random forest models identified striking changes in the virus community. The majority of the cancer-associated virome consisted of temperate bacteriophages, suggesting that the community was indirectly linked to colorectal cancer by modulating bacterial community structure and function. Our data suggested that the influential phages did not exclusively infect influential bacteria, but rather acted through the community as a whole. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and likely impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.",NA

Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",NA

Here we present a method for exhaustive and unsupervised co-abundance gene binning across a series of highly complex metagenomic samples. As the method does not rely on previously sequenced reference genomes it allows for discovery of new species, viruses and clonal heterogeneity. We demonstrate the method on human gut microbiome data and identify 7,381 co-abundance gene groups (CAGs) ranging in size from 3 to 6,319 genes. The CAGs represent a wide variety of biological entities including microbial genomes, phages and clonal differences. We name the 741 largest of these metagenomic species (MGS), because they correspond to microbial species. In addition, we establish microbial host affiliations by dependency-associations for many small CAGs. Longitudinal sampling in the same individuals indicates that some of these dependency-associations are important for the persistence of their microbial host","The microbial diversity of environments like the human gut extends far beyond what is covered by reference genomes.

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment.

However, our understanding of bee viral communities is primarily derived from studies of North America and European Apis mellifera honey bee populations. Here, we develop a novel pipeline to rapidly, inexpensively, and robustly screen for bee viruses. This pipeline includes purification of encapsulated RNA/DNA viruses, sequence-independent amplification, high throughput sequencing, integrated assembly of contigs, and screening through a series of filters to identify contigs specifically corresponding to viral sequences. We evaluated samples of honey bees and co-foraging non-Apis bee species (12 bee species in total) from 9 countries and 5 continents. We identified sequences corresponding to (+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA, dsRNA, and ssDNA viruses. Overall, 127 contigs corresponding to novel viruses (previously not observed in bees), with 29 represented by >0.1% of the reads in a given sample. These 29 contigs corresponded to 9 viral families, including 6 viral families that have not been previously observed in bees. These viruses and viral families were distributed across multiple regions and species. This study provides a robust pipeline for analysis of insect viruses, and greatly expands our understanding of the diversity of viruses found in bee communities.",NA
