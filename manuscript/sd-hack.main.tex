% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{A wealth of viral data sits untapped in publicly-available
metagenomic datasets when it might be extracted to create a usable index for
the virological research community. We hypothesized that work of this
complexity and scale could be done in a hackathon setting. Ten teams comprised
of over 40 participants from 6 countries, assembled to create a crowdsourced
pipeline of datasets in a three-day event on the San Diego State University
campus starting January 9$^{th}$, 2019. Contiguous assemblies (contigs) were
pre-assembled by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) staff
using the SKESA algorithm for a large sample of 141,000 metagenomic datasets
from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA).  During the Hackathon contigs were
aligned using BLAST against all known virus genomes, labeled with domains,
clustered, annotated, and assigned metadata. The work yielded valuable insights
into both SRA data and the cloud infrastructure required to support such
efforts, and the scientific findings will be extended during a follow-up
event.}

%The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.
