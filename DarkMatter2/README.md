In accession SRR5260890, which is putatively a freshwater metagenome sample from Crystal Bog Wisconsin, there were five large contigs named with RefSeq.

  - NC_001479.1 – Encephalomyocarditis virus
  - NC_001352.1 – Human papillomavirus 2 
  - NC_00933.1 – Human herpesvirus 8
  - NC_001716.2 – Human herpesvirus 7
  - NC_001664.3 – Human herpesvirus 6A

They had been assembled in their entirety.  We learned that they are reference sequences and not actual contigs.  Why they are exported in the nominal de novo fasta, is not clear.

These are present in hundreds of assemblies.
